Exploring React Native via Expo

## **TODO:**

- **[Fix]** StyleLint not working with WebStorm `When linting something other than CSS, you should install an appropriate syntax, e.g. "@stylelint/postcss-css-in-js", and use the "customSyntax" option`

## **NOTES:**

- Keep an eye on React-Native typing fixing React@18+ integration
  (get rid of the *resolutions* workaround in the `package.json`)
